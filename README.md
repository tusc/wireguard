## Project Notes

## UPDATE: Please note this version will no longer be updated as the kernel version is now availble which is much more efficient and offers higher throughput: https://github.com/tusc/wireguard-kmod
The tar file in this repository is a collection of binaries that can be loaded onto an UDM to run wireguard in userland mode. If you want to compile your own version you can follow this [guide](https://github.com/tusc/wireguard/blob/master/compiling.md)

ssh into the UDM and type the following command from the /root folder to download the tar file:

```
# curl -LJo udm-wireguard.tar.Z  https://github.com/tusc/wireguard/blob/master/udm-wireguard.tar.Z?raw=true
```

From this directory type the following, it will extract the files under the /mnt/data path:

```
# tar -C / -xvf udm-wireguard.tar.Z
```

Once the extraction is complete, cd into /mnt/data and run the script **setup_bin.sh**. This will setup the symbolic links for the various binaries to the /bin path as well as create a symlink for the /etc/wireguard folder.

**Please Note: you will need to run setup_bin.sh whenever the UDM is rebooted as the symlinks have to be recreated.**

There's a sample wg0.conf in /etc/wireguard you can use to create your own, provided you update the public and private keys. There are various tutorials out there for setting up a client/server config for wireguard (e.g. https://www.stavros.io/posts/how-to-configure-wireguard/ )

In order to start the wireguard tunnel you need to run this command from the cli:

```
# WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION=boringtun wg-quick up wg0
```

you should see output similar to the following:

```
[#] ip link add wg0 type wireguard
RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported
[!] Missing WireGuard kernel module. Falling back to slow userspace implementation.
[#] boringtun wg0 --disable-drop-privileges=1
BoringTun started successfully
[#] wg setconf wg0 /dev/fd/63
[#] ip -4 address add 10.253.0.3/32 dev wg0
[#] ip link set mtu 1420 up dev wg0
[#] ip -4 route add 10.253.0.0/24 dev wg0
```

You can also execute the wg binary for status on the tunnel:

```
# wg

interface: wg0
  public key: ************************
  private key: (hidden)
  listening port: 43724

peer: *********************************
  preshared key: (hidden)
  endpoint: 192.168.1.106:51820
  allowed ips: 10.253.0.0/24
```

 Finally, in order to shutdown the tunnel you'll need to run this command:
 
```
# WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION=boringtun wg-quick down wg0
```
You'll find some other useful utils in the /mnt/data/bin path such as bash, htop, iftop and iperf3.
